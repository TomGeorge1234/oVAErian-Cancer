# oVAErian-Cancer 

![](./figures/readmefigure.png)

I use variational autoencoders to efficiently compress ovarian cancer tumour mRNA data in order to search for and extract latent factors, and then gene expressions, highly predictive of platinum chemotherapy resistance. Finally gene enrichment analysis is then used to identify biological processes potentially important in developing platinum resistance, the leading cause of mortality in ovarian cancer patients.
